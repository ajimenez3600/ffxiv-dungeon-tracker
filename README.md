# FFXIV Dungeon Tracker
Pretty straightforward Vue form to collect instance data

Missing a lot of the below stuff right now, but I'm slowly adding to it
* Roulette data
  * Roulette Bonuses by level & roulette
  * Total XP gain by level & roulette
  * Queue time by level & roulette & role
  * Run duration by level & roulette
  * Total commitment time by level & roulette & role
  * Roulette Efficiency (xp gained versus time spent)
* Instance Data - showing estimated XP gain and run time per instance
* XP calculator - input starting level/xp and what roulettes you want to run and learn what order to run them in, and how long it will take you to reach max level!
